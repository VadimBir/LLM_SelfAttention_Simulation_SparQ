1) Locality based Prefetcher
    Some addresses are repeating but a few of them
        Have a prefetching where repeated addresses in N distance is stored

2) Incremental Stride
    For address A, A+1 access may occure not right after but after B (len N)
    A -> B -> A+1 -> B+1 -> A+2 -> B+2

    B can be len 4 with sequential len 4 access

3)
   USE THIS FOR NEXT 50K Adresses
   If A -> B -> A+1 this would trigger some attempt to prefetch to keep in mind
   ONLY IF there is A+1 and repeated B+1 and after A+1 there is some B+2 then do NEXT LINE STRIDE PREFETCHING

   USE THIS FOR NEXT 50K Adresses
   IF Sequentially A -> A -> A them A must me Locality based prefetcher

^^^^^^^ MANUALLY
